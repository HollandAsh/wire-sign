		<h3>Tips:</h3>

<p class="tipList">Be sure to use <strong>fresh seafood</strong>. That way you'll avoid food poisoning.</p>

<p class="tipList">Curing the raw seafood in citrus juice "cooks" it. Making it safe to eat.</p>

<p class="tipList">Once you finish making cerviche, refrigerate it for half an hour. It tastes great when served chilled.</p>

<p class="tipList">Use a glass or stoneware bowl, a non-porous bowl. Don't use metal or wood because the citrus juice will react with the bowl.</p>

<p class="tipList">Cerviche is best eaten shortly after it's prepared. If there are leftovers, refrigerate them right away. Eat any leftovers the next day, or throw them out.</p>

<p class="tipList">I love to add a swirl of GochuJang sauce on top of each serving. It adds a touch of spicy and sweetness to the dish. Some versions of Cerviche are traditionally served with ketchup.</p>

<p class="tipList">
There are endless variations of Cerviche.<br>
Contrasting colors of seafood and vegetables will look most appealing. <br>
Such as using shrimp, red onion, tomatoes, and cucumber together; such as in the photo below.
