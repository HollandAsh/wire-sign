        <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
        <p>Body Mass Index or BMI<a href="#" class="linkToDisclaimer"><sup>*</sup></a> is a way of using your height and body mass (weight) to classify you as either: underweight, of normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>

          <p id="disclaimer">Please note: BMI is a vague measurement of an individual's body fat. BMI doesn't differentiate between a person with high muscle content and a person with high fat content. If the two people have the same height and weight BMI evaluates both as the same. Meaning that, a muscular person could possibly end up in the obese category.</p>
